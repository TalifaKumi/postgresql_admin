random() Function

SELECT random();
If you try the above syntax it will lead to the following:

psql random function

Generating Random Numbers Within a Range
To generate a random number between 1 and 10, you use the following statement:

SELECT random() * 10 + 1 AS RAND_1_10;
If you try the above syntax it will lead to the following:

psql random function

If you want to generate the random number as an integer, you apply the floor() function to the expression as follows:

SELECT floor(random() * 10 + 1)::int;
The above query results in the following:

psql random function

The result will be an integer between 1 and 10.

Generating Random Numbers Between Two Custom Integers
Generally, to generate a random number between two integers l and h, you use the following statement:

SELECT floor(random() * (h-l+1) + l)::int;
For example, to generate a random number between 20 and 50:

SELECT floor(random() * (50 - 20 + 1) + 20)::int;
Creating a User-Defined Function for Random Numbers
To create a user-generated function that returns a random number between two numbers l and h:

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION random_between(low INT ,high INT) 
   RETURNS INT AS
$$
BEGIN
   RETURN floor(random()* (high-low + 1) + low);
END;
$$ LANGUAGE 'plpgsql' STRICT;
The following statement calls the random_between() function and returns a random number between 1 and 100:

SELECT random_between(1,100);
Output:

psql random function

The output will be an integer between 1 and 100.

Generating Multiple Random Numbers
If you want to get multiple random numbers between two integers, you use the following statement.

SELECT random_between(1,100)
FROM generate_series(1,5);
Output:



This statement returns five random integers within the specified range.
